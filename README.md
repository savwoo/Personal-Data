# Motivation 

The reason why I chose this data set and wanted to pursue looking into what possible reasons why people leave their companies, there can be many factors on why people leave but I wanted to research and figure out on what specific reason on why people leave the most. Pinpointing on what the possible reason on why people are leaving companies wasn't an easy task I wanted an overall picture on why people leave, looking at this vizualization I asked myself is money the biggest factor on why people are leaving? I don't believe that money was the issue at hand. As I dived deeper into the data I figured out some interesting topics that I would love to dicuss with you. While doing some research on main reasons people leave their company there

# Data Process

I recieved this data set from Kaggle, it is based off a large company that is well know (IBM). The reason why I seleceted this company and data set is because I believe that it could answer the question I was looking for becuase many people want corporate jobs that has good benefits, income, and work life balance. While I was sorting through the data I didn't find any issues with the data. With that being said, there was no processing really needed, only simple regressions to find any outliers overall this dataset was fairly straight foward. This table below is just a basic overview on what the data looks like there were no empty columns.

# Visualization

After doing some research I learned that a lot of employees leave because their worklife balance is not fit to their needs especially for those starting a family. As we can see from the martial status that the people that left the company were married from the mid 30's to 40's, my assumption from this table that the reason they left is because of them not having enough time to balance work and their family. If you looked at who stayed from that range of age most of them are single or divorced which was interesting to see. The reason why I added the job satisfaction graph is because I wanted a basic overview seeing if people wihtin this company actually enjoy their job. This graph indicates that many people did not enjoy thier time here at this company which makes sense on why a lot of people left.

 # Analysis 
 For my analysis I wanted to use the simple box plots to see any outliers within job satisfaction which would be my main focus. For obvious reasons why I chose Job satisfaction to be my determining factor, if you're employees aren't happy at the workplace then they'll probably leave which is common sense. I wanted to see if this had any affect on people being married, single, or divorced. Overall it seemed that marriage and job satisfaction were the key determining factors on why people were leaving, both from research and from these vizualizations. As we can see from these two visualizations that whether it be age or years at company it didn't really matter for both age and years at company on why people were leaving this company, their job satisfaction stayed relatively the same overall, which help me conclude that people were either leaving for salary increase at a different company or their needs weren't being met with people starting their families whether that be worklife balance or not enough pay for their families.
