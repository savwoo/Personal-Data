# Motivation 
The reason why I chose this data set and wanted to pursue looking into what possible reasons why people leave their companies, there can be many factors on why people leave but I wanted to research and figure out on what specific reason on why people leave the most. Pinpointing on what the possible reason on why people are leaving companies wasn't an easy task I wanted an overall picture on why people leave, looking at this vizualization I asked myself is money the biggest factor on why people are leaving? I don't believe that money was the issue at hand. As I dived deeper into the data I figured out some interesting topics that I would love to dicuss with you.
