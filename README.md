# Motivation 

The reason why I chose this data set and wanted to pursue looking into what possible reasons why people leave their companies, there can be many factors on why people leave but I wanted to research and figure out on what specific reason on why people leave the most. Pinpointing on what the possible reason on why people are leaving companies wasn't an easy task I wanted an overall picture on why people leave, looking at this vizualization I asked myself is money the biggest factor on why people are leaving? I don't believe that money was the issue at hand. As I dived deeper into the data I figured out some interesting topics that I would love to dicuss with you.

# Data Process

I recieved this data set from Kaggle, it is based off a large company that is well know (IBM). The reason why I seleceted this company and data set is because I believe that it could answer the question I was looking for becuase many people want corporate jobs that has good benefits, income, and work life balance. While I was sorting through the data I didn't find any issues with the data. With that being said, there was no processing really needed, only simple regressions to find any outliers overall this dataset was fairly straight foward. This table below is just a basic overview on what the data looks like there were no empty columns.
